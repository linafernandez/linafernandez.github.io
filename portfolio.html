	  <br>Project 3.2.7
	  <br>The goal is to show data of the number of bans throughout 
	  <br>a half a year with the strategy of tricking people into getting
	  <br>ban if they are doing something wrong or innappropriate in the game.
	  <br>We created ideas and used AndroidL's methods to figure out a pathway 
	  <br>to making videogames more secure.
